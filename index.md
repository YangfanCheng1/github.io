Hello, I am Yangfan, and I am currently a Software Developer with a background in designing/implementing scalable cloud system. I have a lot of deep hands-on experience with bulding a mordern end to end product. This covers a range of topics include but not limited to:
* API Gateway (AuthN/AuthN, throttling, etc)
* Load Balancer
* Microservices (Containers/Autoscaling)
* Communication method (RESTful/GraphQL)
* Error handling (Retry, Timeout, Distributed logging/monitoring/alerting)
* Request Optimization (Caching/Queues)
* Database
* Data Ingestion (Async/Batch processing)
* CICD (Version Control/Artifactory/Rollback plan)

Much of my experience is in the Java/SpringBoot/Docker/Kubernetes/AWS ecosystem. This very much resembles the tech stack at companies like Netflix (which is predomantly a Java shop). A lot of what I use during day-to-day job is very much language/framework specific, but I spent a lot of time in gaining advanced knowledge about each subject, even if they may not directly used at work. For example, some of favorite topics to explore are:
* Java for things like JVM (JIT, GC, Class Loader..), Complier (JSR-269/Annotation Processing, AST/Lombok), Lambda (FI, Vavr, function composition over inheritance), Profiling (Java Instrumentation API)..
* Spring/Boot -- IoC, Template, AutoConfiguration, Die hard fan :)
* MongoDB -- Model (Subset pattern, no ACID (transaction)), Aggregation, Change Stream
